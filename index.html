          Role playing games, such as dungeons and dragons, have been getting more and more poupular in modern culture.
          <br>
          I have a group of friends who meet every week to play together, and I have since before Critical Roll became popular, and before even Stranger Things brought D&D into the public eye again.
          <br>
          Despite what the Satanic Panic of the 1980s tried the make people believe, this game is an excelent way to foster creativity, encourage teamwork, and in my case, even make friends around the world.
          <br>
          I run most of the games for my group, taking the role of the "Game Master", which is just a grandiose way of saying that I control the world the players are playing in.
          <br>
          Between creating entire fictional worlds, characters and fantastic creatures that inhabit those worlds, and the villains that must be stopped from destroying them, I also get to collaborate with the players to tell a story we all want to hear.
          <br>
        
        If this sounds like a lot of work on my end, thats because it is. It is also, however, incredibly rewarding when something I have worked so hard on is recieved how I'd hoped. Thats one of the reasons I keep playing, and keep creating. the kind of happiness i get to share with my friends, the kinds of stories we get to tell, and the feeling of doing a good job keeps me coming back to this hobby over and over again.
          <br>
          In fact, it apparently didn't feel like enough work, because I've recently started working on creating my own offshoot game system, fixing what problems I feel like the current format of D&D has, as well as adding my own touches I think will help add to the experience.
          <br>
          This is no small endeavor either. I'll have to write somewhere around three books just to get the project off the ground, each measuring something like 200-300 pages.
          <br>
          As of right now, im 20 pages into the first book. A lot more work to go.
          <br>
          Its worth it though, because I have amazing friends who reward me for my creativity by creating their own stuff based off of what I have come up with. Its how I imagine writers for comic book characters feel watching movies and shows and spinoffs of their idea. In addition to just my friends, lots of aquantences and people I have met through the hobby have expressed their interest in trying out this game system I'm working on, which in turn makes me more excited to work on it.

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      </div>
      
        <p>
          It doesn't take a lot to get started in the table top role playing game hobby if you have an interest.
          
          <ul>
            <li>A set of dice</li>
            <li>An internet connection</li>
            <li>Some friends</li>
          </ul>
          Even the list above can be mostly ignored, on the grounds that, if you have the necessary materials, then the internet isn't needed, and if you have the internet, there are online rollers that remove the need for analogue dice. That being said, its definently helpful to have all three, and its not to hard to obtain at least the material needs to start playing. going to local game stores, or even forums and chats online can be a good way to get started with talking to people who share the interest.
          <br>
          This hobby is one of the easiest to get into, seeing as its based entirely off imagination and trying to have a good time with friends, and making new friends along the way. If you ever find yourself looking for a fun, nerdy hobby to try, look no further then D&D.

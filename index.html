        <h1>Table Top Role Playing Games</h1>

        <p> Role playing games, such as dungeons and dragons, have been getting more and more poupular in modern culture.
          <br>
          I have a group of friends who meet every week to play together, and I have since before Critical Roll became popular, and before even Stranger Things brought D&D into the public eye again.
          <br>
          Despite what the Satanic Panic of the 1980s tried the make people believe, this game is an excelent way to foster creativity, encourage teamwork, and in my case, even make friends around the world.
          <br>
          I run most of the games for my group, taking the role of the "Game Master", which is just a grandiose way of saying that I control the world the players are playing in.
          <br>
          Between creating entire fictional worlds, characters and fantastic creatures that inhabit those worlds, and the villains that must be stopped from destroying them, I also get to collaborate with the players to tell a story we all want to hear.
      
        </p>
        <p>If this sounds like a lot of work on my end, thats because it is. It is also, however, incredibly rewarding when something I have worked so hard on is recieved how I'd hoped.
          <br>
